# Static Page Format

> Static pages are the least networked and most "meta" part of a music wiki! Static pages represent top-level locations like About & Feedback, the invite to the HSMusic community Discord server, a years-spanning changelog, and more. They can be used for just about anything, but are also totally outside the scope of almost any data additions (save for keeping track of new content in the changelog, for example).

Static page documents are stored each in its own file, at `static/<directory>.yaml`.

## Static page documents

Referenced as `static:directory`.

* `Name`: static page name
* `Short Name`: for use in e.g. homepage navigation bar
* `Directory`: unique identifier among other static pages
* `Style`: extra CSS pertinent to this page's content
* `Content`: full content of static page
