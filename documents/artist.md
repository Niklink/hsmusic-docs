# Artist Format

> Artists are the people responsible for all the music and artwork shared and storied through a music wiki! The actual data files only contain essential info about artists; when you visit an artist's music wiki page, all their crediting information is automatically filled in based on all the data in tracks and other data objects. No need to maintain a prolific composer's lengthy track list yourself!

Artist documents are stored all in one file, `artists.yaml`, one document (entry) per artist.

## Artist documents

Referenced as `artist:directory`; extra links: `[[artist-gallery:directory]]`.

* `Name`: artist name
* `Directory`: unique identifier among other artists
* `URLs`: web URLs where the artist can be visited
* `Context Notes`: pertinent info about the artist

* `Has Avatar`: enable displaying avatar (from `artist-avatars` in media directory)
* `Avatar File Extension`: corresponds to media file

* `Aliases`: list of earlier or non-primary names the artist has gone by
