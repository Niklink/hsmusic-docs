# Album & Track Guidelines

### Name albums and tracks according to Bandcamp release

Generally, HSMusic uses Bandcamp as the primary reference for album listings. Many albums which have been released across multiple platforms have slight differences in track naming (e.g. capitalization) â€” we prefer the naming on Bandcamp first. We also do our best not to editorialize here. Even if different tracks follow different capitalization rules seemingly arbitrarily, we leave that as-is!

When there hasn't been a Bandcamp release, track and album naming can be a bit of a throw. Prefer another music streaming platform first, or whichever platform has the most complete track listing (e.g. if SoundCloud is missing a few tracks while YouTube has the full release, then pull names from YouTube). If the tracks haven't been officially released on *any* platforms, use whatever comes closest to "official" naming: titles as credited in video games, a title the artist passingly called the work when referencing it from some other commentary, etc.

### Differentiate between artists and contributors

(TODO. C'est blurry!)

<!-- Old content: The line between "artists" and "contributors" is grey, and internally, it's an arbitrary distinction. "Artists" generally refers to people who played a major role in composing the track, while "contributors" tends to center on performance. See Harlequin (Rock Version) for an example. -->
